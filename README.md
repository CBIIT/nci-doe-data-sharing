PREDICTIVE ONCOLOGY MODEL AND DATA CLEARINGHOUSE

The Predictive Oncology Model and Data Clearinghouse (MoDaC) is a data-sharing repository developed to transition assets to the broader research community. These assets include datasets and software models from computational capabilities developed within NCI and in collaborative programs, including the Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions for Cancer (JDACS4C) Program and the Accelerating Therapeutics for Opportunities in Medicine (ATOM) Consortium. 

MoDaC supports the community priority for making both data and predictive models FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). MoDaC also fosters reproducibility and supports collaborations among groups developing computational predictive models, including collaborations with the US Department of Energy.
