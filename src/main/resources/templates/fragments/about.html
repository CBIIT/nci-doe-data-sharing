The Model and Data Clearinghouse is a data-sharing repository developed to transition resources to the broader 
research community. These resources include datasets and software models from computational capabilities 
developed within NCI and in collaborative programs, including the <a target="_blank" href="https://datascience.cancer.gov/collaborations/joint-design-advanced-computing">
Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions 
for Cancer (JDACS4C) Program</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://datascience.cancer.gov/collaborations/atom">
Accelerating Therapeutics for Opportunities in Medicine (ATOM) Consortium. </a>
Annotated datasets stored in the repository are publicly available and can be searched against their metadata and 
downloaded.</p>

    <p style="height: 392px;width: 824px;opacity: 0.98;color: #000000;margin-top:-228px;font-family: latoregular;

An account is not needed to perform searches of the repository and view the metadata associated with a Program, 
Study or Dataset collection. Users who create an account can download data. Downloads can be performed 
asynchronously to a Globus endpoint or an AWS S3 bucket, as well as synchronously to the user machine. 
Support for additional transfer endpoints such as Google drive and Google cloud are also under consideration. 
Users can monitor the progress of all their asynchronous downloads at any point in time during the transfer.</p>
